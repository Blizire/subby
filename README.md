webapp  for my wife to put my computer to sleep when I fall asleep watching movies on my windows PC
# installation
not going to put too much info here.. but its a flask webapp forked from my repo simple_serve.
just install flask and run __main.py__

now your wife/gf just needs to set a bookmark to the servers ip address w/ port 5000 and bam
she can put your PC to sleep. if its home pc just setup DHCP reservation or give it a static address.
